# Introduction

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a self-taught french programmer with experience in **Lua**, **Luau**, **C++**, and a bit of **reverse engineering**. I'm passionate about scripting, automation, and understanding how things work under the surface.

I spend most of my time experimenting with client-side scripts, bypass techniques, and building tools related to anti-cheat systems.

# Programming Experience

### Lua / Luau  
I’ve been scripting in Lua/Luau since early 2024, mostly focused on Roblox and FiveM. I’ve worked on scripts for games like **Blox Fruits**, **Phantom Forces**, and **Jailbreak**, and developed tools ranging from basic auto farms to thread-based detection bypasses. Luau quickly became my favorite scripting language due to its flexibility and game-focused environment.

### C++  
I started learning C++ to explore lower-level cheat logic and bypass techniques. I’ve worked on basic DLL injectors, memory operations, and spoofing tools. While I'm still progressing, C++ gives me the performance and control I need for more advanced experiments.

### Python  
I use Python for quick automation, data collection, and tools like checkers, log readers, and file editors. It's fast to write and very useful for scripting support tools around my Lua/C++ projects.

### JavaScript / Node.js  
Occasionally used for utility projects like process/thread watchers or small frontends. I’ve also tested using Node.js for scripting panels and small bots.

### Batch / PowerShell  
Used mainly for automating setup, file generation, and Git-related workflows in personal environments.

# Hobbies and Interests

In addition to programming, I love to indulge in the world of reverse engineering as a hobby. I like to inspect how progams work, while also document their behavior.

I'm constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to improve my skills - and/or gain knowledge. Feel free to contact me about programming, reverse-engineering, or other things. It'd be nice to see issues and pull-requests made on my projects.
